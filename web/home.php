        <p><h2>Hello everyone!</h2> My name is <em>Clayton</em> 
        and I'm finally down to <strong>my last year of school!</strong>
        I started with <a href="https://www.byupathway.org/" target="_none"> Pathway</a> in 2013, 
        so this will be my <em><strong>8th</strong></em> year with BYU-I.
        I also work full time and have a family to care for, including my wife and 3 little girls, 
        so I'm taking just two classes per trimester. 
        I live in Queen Creek, AZ (MST), about 10 minutes away from the 
        <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Gilbert+Arizona+Temple/@33.2905632,-111.7360352,115a,35y,291.35h,53.6t/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x872bacf54a151d19:0x511aefb67f1ba97b!8m2!3d33.2912716!4d-111.7373561?hl=en"
            target="_none"> Gilbert Arizona Temple</a>, 
        and I work from home as a <a href="https://trailhead.salesforce.com/credentials/architectoverview"
        target="_blank"> Salesforce Consultant / Developer / Architect.</a> </p>

        </a>

        <p>
        The major I chose was "University Studies" because it allowed me the most flexibility in terms of the courses I could take to graduate. 
        The courses I chose to take were mostly from CIT and CS departments, 
        with a pinch of Business / Entrepreneurship, 
        as the skills I'd like to improve most for my career revolve around business software development. 
        I don't know if I'll ever own my own business, 
        but I'd like to feel prepared for that if the opportunity ever presented itself. 
        Post graduation, I'd like to learn to play piano, 
        spend more time with my girls, and maybe teach them to play piano too.
